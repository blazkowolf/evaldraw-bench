All my old (and new?) scripts and tooling for EVALDRAW

## Running scripts

Grab a copy of EVALDRAW if you don't have it already (what are you even doing?). You'll need it to run any of the `.kc` files.

To run individual script from the command-line:

```console
$ evaldraw [KC file] /800x600 /runonly
```
